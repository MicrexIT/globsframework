# GlobsEx

**TODO: Add description**

## TODO
- ?add check for cycles in globtypeset (potentially count how many times you go back to the same glob type name and if it is above a certain threshold than stop)
- add back annotations logic in globtype and globtypeset deserializer
- check integration with typescript implementation
